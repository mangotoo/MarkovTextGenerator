# Markov Text Generator

The Markov Text Generator is just that, a text generator that uses markov chains. I'm doing this to primarily refresh my memory on markov chains. Still in its very early stages, my first goal with this project is to create a twitter bot that tweets jokes on par with some of my favourite comedian (Theo Von, Joe Rogan, etc). Beyond that, I aim to create the ultimate Steve Irwin text generator around. Just you wait.
